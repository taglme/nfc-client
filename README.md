Official open-source Golang SDK library for [Taglme Desktop](https://github.com/taglme/desktop).
Quick and efficient way to connect applications with NFC REST API server.

### SDK overview

This SDK is intended to use in conjunction with Taglme Desktop REST API server. It is a thin API wrapper.
The main goal of the SDK is to handle requests complexity by hiding unnecessary details.

Read full [REST API specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Qwelp/nfcd/0.5) in Swagger (OpenAPI) format. 
[SDK documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/taglme/nfc-goclient) is hosted by pkg.go.dev

### API resources overview

* Adapter - represents a NFC reader. 
* Tag - represents NFC tag. 
* Job - represents a set of operations (steps) that should be performed with tag (read, write, format etc). 
Jobs are added to adapter queue and start execution as soon as tag discovered by adapter.
* JobRun  - represents the result of job execution.
* Event - represents the event generated by the server. 
Events are sended by server through web socket connection. Client should listen for event messages in order to get notified when job execution if finished.

### Installation

``` go get github.com/taglme/nfc-goclient ```

### Usage

```Go
import "github.com/taglme/nfc-goclient/pkg"

url := "http://127.0.0.1:3011" // url of the hosted API
locale := "en" // preferred locale to be set on the BE side
client := client.New(url, locale)

// Request to get About info
about, err := client.About.Get()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err) // handle an error
    return
}

fmt.Printf(about.Name) // Print received About.Name
```

#### WS

WS connection is a part of the library functionality via which you are able to receive Events.

```Go
// Initialize the  WS connection
defer func () {
    err = ws.Disconnect() 
    if err != nil {} // handle an error on disconnect
}()

err := client.Ws.Connect()
if err != nil {} // handle an error on init


eHandler := func(e models.Event) {
    // handle the received event
}

client.Ws.OnEvent(eHandler)
```

Also you are able to handle errors in a similar manner

```Go
errHandler := func(e error) {
    // handle the received error
}

client.Ws.OnError(eHandler)
```
